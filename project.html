<h1>The Journey</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>I first stumbled upon FreeCodeCamp when I was stuck in a job that didn’t excite me anymore. I’d always been interested in technology but didn’t know where to start. The idea of learning coding seemed daunting, and I had no formal background in computer science. However, after a few weeks of research, I decided to give FreeCodeCamp a shot. What did I have to lose?
    The first few lessons were eye-opening. The way FreeCodeCamp breaks down programming concepts into bite-sized chunks made the whole thing feel accessible, even for someone with no prior experience. The HTML and CSS sections felt like a creative playground. I could instantly see results when I tweaked code and refreshed my browser, which was incredibly satisfying.<br/>

<p>However, the real challenge came when I started working through the JavaScript curriculum. I remember spending hours stuck on the basic algorithms section, trying to wrap my head around the concepts of loops, arrays, and objects. I’d never felt so frustrated and defeated in my life. But FreeCodeCamp had a fantastic community forum where I could ask questions, and the support I received from fellow learners kept me going. I also used Stack Overflow and YouTube tutorials to complement my learning.
One of the turning points was when I built my first working project—a simple to-do list app. It wasn’t much, but it felt like a huge accomplishment. That small app was the first time I really understood the power of code: the idea that you could build something functional from scratch with just a few lines of text was awe-inspiring.
Over time, I kept pushing myself through more complex challenges, including building projects using React, Node.js, and learning about databases with MongoDB. With every new concept, I felt like I was getting closer to the career I’d dreamed about. My skills kept improving, and with each completed certification, I gained more confidence in my abilities.<br/>

<p>The biggest change in my life, however, wasn’t just the technical skills I acquired. It was the mental shift. I realized that with consistent effort and the right mindset, I could solve problems I once thought were impossible. I learned how to be patient with myself and how to approach problems methodically. Coding became not just a career path, but a mindset.
After about a year of consistent work through FreeCodeCamp, I felt ready to apply for junior developer roles. I landed my first gig as a front-end developer, and the sense of achievement was overwhelming. FreeCodeCamp didn’t just teach me how to code—it transformed my approach to learning and problem-solving. Looking back, the journey wasn’t just about getting a job—it was about building the confidence to try something new, overcome obstacles, and continue learning every day<br/>
